clovis (0.0 : 7.2) : Yeah. So I go through it after some question on your background. But yeah, you will see it's very ambitious and.
adam (7.2 : 13.0) : Basically, there is not one person you will refer to.
SPEAKER_00 (14.0 : 30.2) : Okay, great. So let me see. So you're in the early stages of this company. Have you raised money? What are you planning to do in terms of raising.
clement (30.2 : 31.5) : We have.
clement (32.3 : 60.1) : Like five years of experience in the business. We have built few eco commerce brands. We have lived three years in Dubai and so we made the huge amount of money in the past with our previous businesses. So we will bootstrap the company for I think the first years. So we don't really need money to raise fund anything like that. We already have what we need for now for recru. Amazing.
SPEAKER_00 (57.7 : 76.5) : CorpsPru Amazing. So what is your timeline in terms of. Okay, so you said that you want to bootstrap the company that will give you the Runway for one year. At least. At least one year. Okay. And how soon are you hoping to get this out to market?
clement (77.8 : 83.8) : We can have a first version of the product maybe in, like, six months, for example.
SPEAKER_00 (84.2 : 85.6) : Six months, okay?
SPEAKER_00 (86.9 : 88.0) : Even less.
adam (87.0 : 110.6) : Even less. We can build like a few ways to develop our project and benchmark with the most relevant one and continueing that and for sure iterate with a version of our product is really limited with some early testers, but.
clovis (110.6 : 138.9) : Yeah, the goal is, is maybe even to do something. I don't like that world, but maybe crappy at the beginning, but just to see the market and to iterate over it. And the goale is to maybe rest fun in a longer term. But when we want to raise, fund to already have traction, already have users and be able to raise what we need and not be in a complicated situations, all the stuff.
SPEAKER_00 (139.1 : 148.5) : Okay. And is there any kind of marketing strategy around, say, this beta launch of 6 months or sooner?
SPEAKER_00 (150.1 : 153.0) : How. How are we goingna introduce this product?
clement (154.6 : 201.0) : So our goal is mainly to be a decision driving tool. So it's to optimize decision of leadership in companies, maybe tech companies. So our goal is to like networking a lot in the Silicon Valley to meet a few leaders in the company. So cto, cio, all this stuff and explain our product and then make several add campaigns, because that's what we can do. Also, we have done it in the past and it was very successful. So we can leverage with Facebook, with Instagram, with Twitter, with LinkedIn, so we know how to do ads. That's not a problem for us. So with these two strategies, I think we can touch a lot of people.
SPEAKER_00 (201.7 : 205.1) : That's great. And do you have a network in Silicon Valley yet?
clement (205.7 : 212.3) : Not that. Not yet. Not yet. We knew few people, but I don't think we can call that a network for sure.
SPEAKER_00 (213.1 : 217.8) : Okay, well, I do know a couple of people, and.
SPEAKER_00 (218.6 : 227.2) : I would be able to help in terms of connecting with everyone. So the network is larger, that's fine.
adam (225.2 : 228.3) : Yeah, that's fine. That's key. At the beginning.
SPEAKER_00 (228.3 : 232.6) : Yeah. And, um, so, let's see.
clovis (233.5 : 249.0) : Maybe if you want, we can go a bit deeper into the product because I don't know what you've understood for the moment because there is no a lot of information on the job post and even on the website. Maybe you can describe a bit what you've understood and then we can explain more.
