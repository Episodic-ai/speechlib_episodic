"""
This script processes speech segments extracted from an audio file, organizes them by speaker, 
saves corresponding audio clips, and logs transcriptions with timestamps. The key functionalities include:

1. **Organizing Speaker Audio Data:**
   - Each speaker is assigned a unique identifier (UUID for "SPEAKER_XX" labels, actual name otherwise).
   - Speaker-specific folders are created within the `unidentified_speakers` directory.

2. **Storing Speaker Audio Clips:**
   - For speakers whose names do *not* start with "SPEAKER_", up to 4 audio segments are stored if their folder has fewer than 4 files.
   - Segments are sorted by duration, and the longest one is saved as `verification_sample.wav`.
   - All saved segments are capped at a maximum length of 15 seconds.

3. **Generating a Log File:**
   - A structured log file is created with timestamps and transcriptions of each speaker.
   - Each speaker's speech segment, along with its start and end timestamps, is recorded in the log.

4. **File Handling and Storage Management:**
   - Ensures all necessary directories exist before storing files.
   - Prevents exceeding the 4-file limit for non-"SPEAKER_" speakers.
   - Writes speaker identifiers and their corresponding segments into a `.txt` log.

This system is designed to efficiently categorize and store speech data while maintaining constraints 
on the number of stored files per speaker.
